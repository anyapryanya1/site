                <p>
                    The Big Dipper is an asterism formed by seven bright stars in the constellation Ursa Major, the Great Bear.
                    It is one of the most recognizable star patterns in the night sky. The asterism is well-known in many cultures and goes by many other names, 
                    including the Plough, the Great Wagon, Saptarishi, and the Saucepan </p>

                <p>
                    Cetus constellation is located in the northern sky. Also known as the Whale, it is one of the largest constellations in the sky.
                    The constellation was named after Cetus, the sea monster from the Greek myth about Andromeda.
                    In the myth, the princess was sacrificed to the monster as punishment for her mother Cassiopeia’s boastfulness.
                    The constellation Cetus lies in the region of the sky called the Water, along with several other constellations with names evocative of water: Eridanus (the river). </p>

                <p>
                    Leo is a highly recognizable constellation, as it is one of the few constellations that resemble its namesake. 
                    It is fairly easy to find because the "pointer stars" of the Big Dipper point to Leo.
                    March does come in with a lion. The constellation becomes visible in the Northern Hemisphere around the spring equinox and is easily identifiable through May.
                    Leo lies between Cancer to the west and Virgo to the east.. </p>
